      "Why, who me, why?  Feet don't fail me now Take me to your finish line  Oh my heart it breaks every step that I take",
      "But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine Walking through the city streets",
      "Is it by mistake or design? I feel so alone on a Friday night Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine? It's like I told you, honey",
      "Don't make me sad, don't make me cry Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough",
      "I don't know why Keep making me laugh Let's go get high The road is long, we carry on Try to have fun in the meantime",
      "Come take a walk on the wild side Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain You like your girls insane So choose your last words, this is the last time 'Cause you and I, we were born to die"

      "Don't, don't punish me for what I feel, Don't, don't punish me for what I feel",
      "So I crawled out of the back door, Took off all these tight clothes, Jumped into the water",
      "Vicious demons on the TV So I sold it on 16th St But I still hear the drone",
      "Do you think I could get a lift? I don't care where you're going"

      "Cos I like the way you're calling to me, Your spell upon me, You're something out of a dream and I like it, though I fight it",
      "It took a while for the medicine to sink in Blow out the fog and remove all the cobwebs",
      "Over my shoulder following the whispers People ask me where I’m going in such haste"
